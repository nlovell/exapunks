## About the Game

**The year is 1997. You used to be a hacker, but now you have the phage. You made a deal: one hack, one dose. There’s nothing left to lose… except your life.**

`EXAPUNKS` is the latest open-ended puzzle game from Zachtronics, the creators of Opus Magnum, SHENZHEN I/O, TIS-100, and more.

- **READ ZINES** - Learn to hack from `TRASH WORLD NEWS`, the underground computer magazine. Tutorials, hacking tips, secret information, searing commentary—  `TRASH WORLD NEWS` has you covered.
- **WRITE VIRUSES** - Program your `EXA`s (EXecution Agents) to tear through networks, replicate themselves, trash files, terminate other EXAs— and leave without a trace.
- **HACK _EVERYTHING_** - Hack banks, universities, factories, TV stations, highway signs, game consoles, the government... oh yeah, and your own body.

Get it now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/716490/EXAPUNKS/).
